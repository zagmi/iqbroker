### What's new?

This project is the same as the [original](https://github.com/iqoptionapi/iqoptionapi) except that it allows using recent versions of `websocket-client`.

"Why copy it and publish it in a new repository?", well let me tell you that the maintainer is missing, he doesn't see the issues or review the PRs.

If you want to read the docs I invite you to see the [original](https://github.com/iqoptionapi/iqoptionapi) repository, if you want to use recent versions of `websocket-client` I invite you to install this package.
